# Nexus: Accessible centralized esports gaming platform

The concept of Nexus is to create an application that enables anyone to experience the insane energy and thrill of in-person competitive esports gaming. With the growing demand of competitive ranked gaming the world needs a centralized platform. in other words One rank to rule them all. users will be able to create participate or spectate both rewarded and non-rewarded ranked esports events in their local community in an organized and streamlined manner. I aim to bring back the electric atmosphere of the old arcades that my father spoke of, while infusing it with the beauty of modern gaming technology.

## Project Status

# Implemented Features:
  role player:
- Player can authenticate via Google.
- Player are shown an onboarding section to build their profile.
- Player can add their age, image, and username to use on the app.
- Player are then given a list of popular games with active sports organizations.
- Player can click on a game and it will display a page with more information on that game, almost like a profile itself.
- Player can link their game and platform from the page (only CS implemented) then send to dash
- Users that have no clan get sent to the clan screen in the dashboard.
- Users can browse clans nearby in an intuitive maps view or create their own.
- Users can view their own profile.

  role venue:
  - venue can authenticate via google

# MVP

## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?
      - This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.  

#### Example:  

This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Twitter API based on what they were interested in, such as 'most tagged users'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, Auth0, and two-factor authentication using Firebase or other third parties. Due to project time constraints, I had to table authentication and focus more on data visualization from parts of the API that weren't restricted to authenticated users.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, LoDash, D3, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a `webpack.config.js` file to more fully understand the build process.
