# Nexus: Accessible centralized esports gaming platform

The concept of Nexus is to create an application that enables anyone to experience the insane energy and thrill of in-person competitive esports gaming. With the growing demand of competitive ranked gaming the world needs a centralized platform. in other words One rank to rule them all. users will be able to create participate or spectate both rewarded and non-rewarded ranked esports events in their local community in an organized and streamlined manner. I aim to bring back the electric atmosphere of the old arcades that my father spoke of, while infusing it with the beauty of modern gaming technology.
