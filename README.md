# Nexus: Accessible centralized esports gaming platform
Nexus is an app designed to bring the energy and excitement of in-person esports to anyone, anywhere. It's a centralized platform that allows users to create, participate, or spectate rewarded ranked esports events in their local community. My goal is to recreate the electric atmosphere of old arcades and lan battles my Father spoke of while infusing it with modern gaming technology.
