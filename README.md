Climb: Competitive Esports Gaming Platform
The concept of Climb is to create an application that enables anyone to experience the insane energy and thrill of in-person competitive esports gaming. With an easy-to-use centralized platform, users will be able to create or participate in both rewarded and non-rewarded esports events in an organized and streamlined manner. I aim to bring back the electric atmosphere of the old arcades that my father spoke of, while infusing it with the beauty of modern gaming technology.

Implemented Features
Users can authenticate via Google.
Users are shown an onboarding section to build their profile.
Users can add their age, image, and username to use on the app.
Users are then given a list of popular games with active sports organizations.
Users can click on a game and it will display a page with more information on that game, almost like a profile itself.
Users can link their game and platform from the page (only CS implemented). All data gathered is added to our database (ranks, stats, profile data, etc...) and sent to a secure route.
Users that have no clan get sent to the clan screen in the dashboard.
Users can browse clans nearby in an intuitive maps view or create their own.
Users can view their own profile.
